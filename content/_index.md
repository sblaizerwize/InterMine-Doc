# **Welcome**

![SM]({{< resource url="/resume/salomon-marquez.png" >}})
&nbsp; 

Salomon holds a Ph.D. in Electronics Engineering. He has over six years of academic writing experience and has published in peer-reviewed international journals. His technical background enables him to dive deep into the tech stack of projects to make complex concepts more comprehensible for different audiences.

Salomon immersed himself into the world of technical writing in 2017 when he participated in the first edition of Wizeline's Technical Writing Academy. It is until September 2019 that he joined the TW team at Wizeline. Since then, he has collaborated on projects oriented toward different services such as dating, financial technologies, and video streaming platforms. Salomon likes projects with significant technical challenges that allow him to learn new technologies and establish a collaborative work strategy between stakeholders, developers, and other TWs and thus create a clear awareness of the importance of documentation.

His current interests encompass programming, cloud computing, and data engineering. Check [**Salomon's portfolio**](https://sblaizerwize.github.io/posts/) to learn more about his work.

# **Projects**
- **Video streaming services** \
    Integration of a streaming platform into STB devices. I created how-to guides that helped newcomers configure their devices and routers. I also supported the quality testing team and carried out project management tasks. The development team worked with JavaScript, RESTful APIs, and AWS Athena.

- **Financial services** \
    Migration of a legacy-based financial system into a microservice-based architecture. I created how-to guides that helped developers to connect to databases, monitor resources, manage parameters, deploy applications using Octopus, and query data using AWS Athena. I produced glossaries, policies, and user guides and implemented a Docs-like-Code approach to deliver technical documentation in a static site powered by Hugo and hosted in GitLab Pages.

- **Dating services** \
    Integration of BlueSnap, Stripe, and Apple Pay payment processors with customer services. I created sequence diagrams and API documentation that helped developers to understand the flow of payment transactions for payment processors, including Stripe, BlueSnap, and Apple Pay.

# **Open Source**
I contributed to the Open Source Initiative (OSI) at Wizeline by conducting the followings tasks:

- Analyzed existing OSIs from third-party companies to define the OSI at Wizeline
- Helped on the design of the OSI guidelines at Wizeline by defining and documenting the main contribution pathways: getting to know OS, using OS, contributing to OS, and creating a new OS project. 
- Supported the launching of the [first open source project at Wizeline](https://github.com/WizelineLabs/gitwize-fe) on the documentation side by creating the README files of the project’s repositories
- Created a [repository](https://github.com/WizelineLabs/template) containing documentation and licenses that served as a template to generate new open source projects at Wizeline
- Created a Kanban board to organize, prioritize and keep tracking of tasks on the documentation side. This strategy fostered the collaboration and contribution of a team of three TWs to the Open Source initiative

# **Presentations**
- *TW Academy at Wizeline (Spring 2022)* 
    - Lecturer of the session How to Write Software Architectures. I created and delivered the material for this session in a video format for on-demand studying. 
    - Mentored two students 

- *TW Academy at Wizeline (May 2021)* \
    Mentored one student. Some responsibilities included: review assignments, have weekly one-on-one sessions to provide training and best practices, assess the student’s cultural fit, and complete the student's rubric.

- *TW Academy at Wizeline (March 2020)* \
    Lecturer of the session How to Write Software Architectures

# **Leadership Initiatives at Wizeline**

- I led a study group of 16 technical writers for three months to pursue the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. Some activities included: define and organize study materials, coordinate study sessions, create questions that fostered discussions, and give demos.

- I mentored three technical writers joining the TW team for six months. Some activities included: conduct peer reviews, support their career growth, identify opportunity areas and how to cope with them, and help them unblock any stoppers.

- I led the TW onboarding squad for one year. Primary responsibilities included: send a welcome email to new technical writers along with a handful of useful resources to get onboarded, revamp the TW style guide assessment, and provide guidance to TW team leads on how to support their mentees.
