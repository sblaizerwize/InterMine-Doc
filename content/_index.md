During this time, he has produced useful and high-quality documentation for clients requiring the implementation of different payment processors such as Stripe, Bluesnap, and Apple Pay. He has delivered documentation using plain PDFs, Wiki pages, and static site generators. The documentation includes sequence diagrams, APIs, developer's guides and user's guides.

Salomon holds a Ph.D. in Electronics Engineering. He has over 10 years of experience in academic writing and has published in international peer-reviewed journals. His technical background enables him to dive into the project's tech stack to better understand its requirements. This also allows him to establish better communication channels with the development team.
